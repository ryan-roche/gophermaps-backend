# /web/img

Images for markdown instructions should go here

## Naming Scheme

They are to be named with the following scheme:
`startnode-endnode-##.png/jpg`, where

- `startnode` is the ID of the neo4j node corresponding to the starting location of the instructions this image is used in
- `endnode` is the ID of the neo4j node corresponding to the ending location of the instructions this image is used in
- `##` is the index of the image within the instructions

> [!NOTE] For example, the second image in the instruction markdown file `abc-xyz.md` would be `abc-xyz-1.png`
