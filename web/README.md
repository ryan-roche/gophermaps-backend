Instruction markdown files are to be put here.

## Naming Scheme

They are to be named with the following scheme:
`startnode-endnode.md`, where

- `startnode` is the ID of the neo4j node corresponding to the starting location of the instructions
- `endnode` is the ID of the neo4j node corresponding to the ending location of the instructions

> [!NOTE] You can just use sensible placeholders for the `startnode` and `endnode` (something like `kh1-th2.md` for Keller Hall 1 to Tate Hall 2) until we get the Neo4j database generated and have all the node IDs.
